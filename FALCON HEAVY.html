        <h1>UNMATCHED PERFORMANCE</h1>
<p>With more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, Falcon Heavy is one of the most capable rockets flying.
     By comparison, the liftoff thrust of the Falcon Heavy equals approximately eighteen 747 aircraft at full power.
     Falcon Heavy can lift the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 jetliner—complete with passengers, luggage and fuel—to orbit.</p>
     <p><big><big>Falcon Heavy</big></big> is a partially reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle that is produced by SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer.
         The rocket consists of two strap-on boosters made from Falcon 9 first stages, a center core also made from a Falcon 9 first stage,
          and a second stage on top.[8] Falcon Heavy has the second highest payload capacity of any currently operational launch vehicle behind
           NASA's Space Launch System, and the fourth-highest capacity of any rocket to reach orbit, also trailing the Saturn V and Energia.</p>
           <h3>Design and development</h3>
           <p>The Falcon Heavy design is based on Falcon 9's fuselage and engines. By 2008, SpaceX had been aiming for the first launch of Falcon 9 
            in 2009, while "Falcon 9 Heavy would be in a couple of years". Speaking at the 2008 Mars Society Conference, Musk also indicated 
            that he expected a hydrogen-fueled upper stage would follow two to three years later (which would have been around 2013).[22]</p>
            <h3>Conception and funding</h3>
<p>Musk mentioned Falcon Heavy in a September 2005 news update, referring to a customer request from 18 months prior.[20]
     Various solutions using the planned Falcon 5 (which was never flown) had been explored, but the only cost-effective, 
     reliable iteration was one that used a 9-engine first stage — the Falcon 9. The Falcon Heavy was developed with private
      capital with Musk stating that the cost was more than US$500 million. No government financing was provided for its development.[21]</p>
      <h3>Testing</h3>
<p>By May 2013, a new, partly underground test stand was being built at the SpaceX Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor,
     Texas, specifically to test the triple cores and twenty-seven rocket engines of the Falcon Heavy.[26] By May 2017, SpaceX conducted
      the first static fire test of flight-design Falcon Heavy center core at the McGregor facility.[27][28]</p>
      <h3>Maiden flight</h3>
<h5>Main article: Falcon Heavy test flight</h5>
<p>In April 2011, Musk was planning for a first launch of Falcon Heavy from Vandenberg
    Air Force Base on the West Coast in 2013.[23][31] SpaceX refurbished Launch Complex 4E at
     Vandenberg AFB to accommodate Falcon 9 and Heavy. The first launch from the Cape Canaveral 
     East Coast launch complex was planned for late 2013 or 2014.[32]</p>
     <h3>Later flights</h3>
<p>A year after the successful demo flight, SpaceX had signed five commercial contracts worth US$500–750 million, 
    meaning that it had managed to cover the development cost of the rocket.[52] The second flight, and first commercial one,
     occurred on 11 April 2019,[53] launching Arabsat-6A, with all three boosters landing successfully for the first time.</p>

<p>The third flight occurred on 25 June 2019, launching the STP-2 (DoD Space Test Program) payload.
    [53] The payload was composed of 25 small spacecraft.[54] Operational Geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) 
    missions for Intelsat and Inmarsat, which were planned for late 2017, were moved to the Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket
     version as it had become powerful enough to lift those heavy payloads in its expendable configuration.[55][56] In June 
     2022, the U.S. Space Force certified Falcon Heavy for launching its top secret satellites, with the first such launch being
     USSF-44 which happened at 1 November 2022;[57] it successfully launched on 1 November 2022.[58] and the second of which being
      USSF-67,[59]which was launched 11 weeks after USSF-44.</p>

SEA LEVEL| VACUUM
Merlin is a family of rocket engines 
developed by SpaceX for use on its Falcon 1,
Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles.
Merlin engines use a rocket grade kerosene
(RP-1) and liquid oxygen as rocket propellants
in a gas-generator power cycle. The Merlin engine
was originally designed for recovery and reuse.
